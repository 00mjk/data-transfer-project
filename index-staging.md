## Who we Are
Data Transfer Project (DTP) is a collaboration of industry partners committed to building a common framework with open-source code that can connect any two providers, enabling a seamless, direct transfer between the two platforms.

We want_ _all users across the web to feel in control of their data.

### How it works

Add text here on how it works

## Initial Data portability enabled
The initial set of file types supported by the DTP ecosystem which can be moved directly between service providers include:  

+  photos
+  email
+  contacts
+  posts
+  Calendar  

The DTP partners are actively working to extend the supported set of data format types, and we are actively looking for partners to help us in this area. Additional file types for service-to-service transfer the DTP will support include documents, spreadsheets, videos, sensor data, .dwg and more.  

We hope to eventually include all file types across all services.

## Initial set of Integration  
The following sites have APIs available that have adaptors that enable them transfer files in and out of their service using the DTP framework.

+  Google

    +  Photos, calendar, mail, contacts, tasks

+  Microsoft

    +  Calendar, contacts

+  Flickr

    +  Photos

+  Instagram

    +  Photos

+  Rememberthemilk

    +  Tasks

+  

## How to Participate

### Integrate a service  
If you just want to enable your service to share files using the Data Transfer Project toolset, check out the Integration Guide on  Github and download the code

Any provider who incorporates this code into their current platform gives users the ability to transfer their data to or from the provider. For example, with this tool fully implemented, anyone could transfer their photos from one photos service provider to another seamlessly.

### Hosting options for a DTP Service  
Partners may host an instance of DTP configured to their needs on any docker-based platform.  Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure already have pre-built tools for hosting DTP.

### Contribute to the platform  
If you would like to write an API to a new data type and/or extend the DTP framework see Developer Documentation on the Data Transfer Project Github site.

## About Us

The Data Transfer Project was started by Google in 2017 to create a service open-source service-to-service portability platform so all users across the web can have control over their data.  

The partners in the Data Transfer Project believe  portability and interoperability are central to innovation. Making it easier for users to choose among services facilitates competition, empowering them to try new services and choose the offering that best suits their individual needs.

We anticipate the Data Transfer Project open-source code will make a particularly big impact in markets where downloading or uploading data is expensive or slow, as this platform reduces these costs and significant time for users
